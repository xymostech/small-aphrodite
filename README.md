# Small Aphrodite

This is a stripped down version of Aphrodite that I made to demonstrate the
simplicity of the core of Aphrodite. It probably shouldn't be used for actually
generating styles, but it should work if it was used for that (and at 1k
gzipped it is a pretty enticing option).

The entirety of the code is in one 110 line file, [src/index.js](src/index.js)
and it can be easily read through and understood (comments incoming). Enjoy!
